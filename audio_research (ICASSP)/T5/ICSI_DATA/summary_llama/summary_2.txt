The speaker is discussing the use of a specific file format, likely developed at ICSI, for storing speech data, specifically utterance numbers and frame numbers, which can be time-consuming to parse due to their sequential nature. They consider using an existing standard format, such as the NIST's atlas, which is a graph representation, but is concerned about the stability and completeness of the format, as it was still under development when last checked. The speaker also mentions the ICSI format being easy to parse and having a more structured approach, but notes that it may be less flexible than the atlas format. They are open to using the atlas format, but want to ensure it is stable and compatible with their needs.
