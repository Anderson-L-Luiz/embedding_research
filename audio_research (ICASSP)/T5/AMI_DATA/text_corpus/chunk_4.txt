##dler wrote the novel . you see , it ' s the last but one paragraph on your side . yeah , yeah , so it ' s a novel . but then the story goes that way that film was in production and director oward oaks . okay , you are right , it was a book . okay , so it ' s about a guy called the dood . i don ' t know how you pronounce it . and it ' s actually smoking pots and doing nothing . it ' s just living in la . it ' s a typical fellow from the suburb . and he has some friends , typical friends . one is an old guy coming back from vietnam , obsessed by vietnam . another guy was never speaking . and they all pay together a bowling . and the casting is very interesting . there is . . . okay , actually i wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie . maybe it ' s going to open the discussion on posters as well . so actually , here you . . . on this . . . the first poster , you can see the actors from the movie . i don ' t know if you know some of them . so jeff bridges at the top . good man is the second one , the big guy . then thirdoro . and the last one is mochini . and i don ' t remember the name of the girl . it ' s julian morris . yeah , julian morris . you wrote the paragraph on the poster ? i took it from . . . i don ' t know where . actually , i edited a bit . actually , i ' m not going to describe much more the big labels but it ' s quite hard to describe . it ' s a journey about this guy . but it ' s a movie quite surrealistic . i mean , there are some parts that are coming from dreams . why the movie is called the big lebowski ? why the big ? a lebowski is his family name , right ? but why is it called ? it ' s his family name . and actually , jeff ray lebowski is the . . . there is a story with another lebowski . yeah , it ' s a lebowski . and why the big lebowski is the second one ? i don ' t remember . maybe it ' s just because of the big sleep . there is a reference . so it ' s kind of . . . it ' s like american beauty in some way . it ' s even worse . we see worse people . so it ' s kind of an ethnographic movie , i would say . and it ' s a modern hero . it ' s quite fun . and the casting is marlou . so that ' s it for this movie . and i just wanted to go to the design of the poster , actually . like i like that . yeah , it ' s probably a bit dark for a poster , but . . . yeah , otherwise it ' s very dark . the idea is also to discuss the content . should we put a summary of the movie or the plot ? and what kind of information do we want ? so that ' s the first poster . there is also this poster . quite dark also . so i don ' t know if you cannot really see , but . . . there is the pricing information . so we say that one movie is 8 francs and 3 movies , 18 francs . and we can have a annual subscription of 60 francs . i wanted to say some information to involves people in the committee as well . if they want to take part in the committee to select movies . and what else ? so . . . this is not bad because they say something a little bit about our movie club . and the big club of skits cleared it ' s movie . and i guess the people can remember that it was a movie , at least . even if they haven ' t seen it . looks like a cd cover . yeah , actually the idea was to . . . yeah , there is at the bottom a scene from one of these dreams of the big lebowski . yeah , okay , it ' s a dream . and the first part is actually you see a koboji and the hero , the jeffrey lebowski , the dude . and the koboji , it ' s actually . . . at the beginning of the movie , the koboji introduced the story and he ' s coming back at the end of the story . and he ' s explaining what kind of movie you are going to see . okay , sounds a bit crazy . and last poster . . . so same principle , but i don ' t know . i was thinking of adding some quoteations of well - known directors . i like it because it ' s not so dark , so the images are a bit brighter . i actually don ' t like it . and the contrary , i would say there ' s too many colors and . . . it looks like two separate posters . although i think you can mix . . . i would keep the format of the first one . add the quotes and the content information from the second one . yeah , that would be the best one . so take those quotes , get rid of that section of text . put those quotes in there . put the information you had in the second poster about the movie club had a join . okay , and in the middle , and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up . okay , i see . what about the brighter background ? because this one . . . i don ' t know how it would show one wall or something like this . it doesn ' t really catch your attention . i think it does . i think the contrast between the strip of film and the strip of pictures and everything else is . . . okay , i see what i wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie . what you want to have on the poster . because we did . . . the poster was very good on the second one . okay , on that one . yeah , so take all of that . all of this information and throw it up into the first one . and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the famous directors , sort of at the bottom or something like that . or just one of them . yeah , just one of them . okay , great . so i think now we have to decide for a movie . and . . . oh , yeah . so i would suggest . . . some big levels . if it ' s not too long , maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies . we make a list and then we vote . okay , good idea . what do you think ? yeah . so , what ' s . . . so , mirac , what do you nominate ? so . . . i ' m reconvened by the big level of skin . you are ? yes , yeah . and i would like to . . . at least to have it in the . . . in the nominees . in the nominees ? exactly . another nominee . and . . . you ' re a suspect . remember all of them . okay , agnes , usual suspects . mainly because only two of us have seen it . and it ' s not mainstream movies . i don ' t think a lot of people would have seen it to begin with . yeah . you can nominate one or two so that we . . . or whatever . i would nominate . . . well , okay , my candidate , saving private ryan . and i ' m happy with your nominations too . i would nominate also pulp fiction because it ' s a very good movie . do you ? i would nominate . . . yours is already nominated , but . . . american beauty as well . yeah . and . . . and i would be okay with saving private ryan . okay , so it ' s already on the list . and then i ' m still hesitating between the schindler ' s list and the silence of the lamps . may nominate all these three movies . big lebovsky ' s list and the silence of the lamps . so . . . so we have seven candidates . if you have a good short - term memory , that should be okay . so you ' re using my wet too . so big lebovsky ' s usual suspects . saving private ryan , pulp fiction , american beauty , schindler ' s list and silence of the lamps . so now let ' s vote . should we vote just for one film or should each of us say . . . so , eliminate first . oh , we can eliminate first one movie each and then we select . i ' m sorry , could you go to . . . okay , once again through the list of the movie because i don ' t know . big lebovsky ' s . . . is it possible to put them on the whiteboard ? i can write on your paper , maybe . the schindler ' s list , the usual suspects , silence of the lamps . big lebovsky ' s . . . american beauty . in saving private ryan . okay . so . . . so . . . i ' m missing one . what am i missing ? top fiction . yeah , pulp fiction . okay . so each of us chooses one to eliminate . yeah , six . i have six . that ' s a bit cruel , but . . . seven . that ' s a good way . okay . american beauty . the knee ? yeah , you will remove silence of the lamps because i think it ' s too violent . okay . i will just remove it this way . i will remove schindler ' s list because it ' s too sad . okay . well , not very good reason for that . pulp fiction . well , too bad . and i would have a reason for it or . . . i ' m not a huge fan of quentin tarantino . okay . and i would have made pulp fiction actually as well if so . . . maybe you can eliminate another one . no , no . no , no . i will be the first to have a reason . it ' s gone . okay . so we ' re left with
