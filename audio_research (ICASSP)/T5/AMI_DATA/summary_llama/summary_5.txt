The group is discussing which movie to show and the person who has to decide is asked to vote. They decide to go with "The Big Lebowski" as it has posters ready, but another person hasn't seen "American Beauty" and likes it, and another person also likes "The Usual Suspects". They decide to show "The Big Lebowski" but also plan to discuss and decide on a movie for a meeting in May, potentially around May 3rd, avoiding holidays like Ascension Day.
