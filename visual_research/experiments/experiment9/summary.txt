The main technical points from the transcript are:
- The circuit is identical to exercise number three, with the same values and the same moment of investigation.
- The current I_L is given and the impedance and voltage at the coil L are calculated.
- The partial currents and voltages are calculated using Ohm's law and the fact that the current I_L is real.
- The phase angle between the current I_L, the total current I, and the total voltage U is determined using the phase difference between the imaginary and real parts of the voltage U.
- The phase diagram is drawn, showing the relationship between the current I_L, the voltage U, and the current I_R at the resistance.
- The voltage at the capacitance is calculated and found to lag 90 degrees behind the current I_L.
- The total voltage U is calculated using the vector addition of the current I_L, the current I_R, and the voltage U at the capacitance.
