\n\n Say I was welcome to exercise number four of AC circuits. Now if we have a look at this one, you will find that it is very similar to exercise number three because it's exactly the same circuit with exactly the same values. The only difference is that now in this case we don't have a knowledge about the voltage that is applied but we know the voltage I L is two amps here. So we have I L is two amps flowing through this coil here. Again we have to calculate the partial currents and voltages, the total current and voltage and we have to sketch the phasor diagram and determine the phase angle between the current, the total current and the total voltage. And for a solution now we choose the moment of investigation so that this current I L through the inductance here is instantaneously real so it's only a real part and now phase shift. Okay, so let's jump into the exercise. Once again let's write down everything that we know and this is of course totally equal to exercise number three because nothing has changed in this system. It just have a different start point let's see. Okay, so as we have the current I L given here and we can easily calculate the impedance at the coil set L which is Chai Omega L then we can easily calculate the voltage U L Q which is Chai Omega L multiplied with the current I L and this is of course the same a voltage that is applied at the resistance here so U R is U L and this leads to this value here. And then of course we can calculate the partial current I R because this is the voltage that we calculated here divided by the resistance leads to this value and of course we know the total current I is I L plus I R and this leads to this value here. So what is missing is the voltage here at the capacitor but this is also we have calculated now I see we have we know the current and of course we know from all these values here we can calculate the impedance which is 1 divided by Chai on Gasea and then this means this expression here can be calculated to this value for the voltage you see. And the total voltage is again voltage you see plus the voltage of this parallel system here which is U R L or U R or U L it's obviously the same and this leads to this expression here. Ah here is a mistake of course it's not a pair the voltage is a voltage so this is a copy and paste mistake here must be VW. Okay then let's calculate the phase shift. So the phase shift the phase between the total current I and the total current U is always given by the initial phase VU minus the initial phase VI and VU this is given by our correspondence of 41.321 so this is this one. No I'm sorry our constituents of the imaginary part yeah this is this one divided by the real part and this is this number here and also for VI we have the our past summons of the imaginary part so this is this one yeah divided by the real part which is equal to 2 here and this leads to a 93.36 degrees minus 55 degrees so this is minus 15.64 degrees. Okay now let's come to the phase diagram. As I know from the exercise that the current I L has to be chosen to be real in this moment of investigation so this means our only can point I L to the right parallel to or in the direction of the real axis so I L is along the real axis pointing to the right if no phase shift here and then of course a no when I L is given UL for a coil must lead the voltage leads the current in a coil by 90 degrees so UL must point upwards and UL of course is equal to UR. Now if you know the voltage at the resistance and of course the current at the resistance is in phase and I can shift this one to this position and then I have the vector addition and I have the total current I is I L plus I R. Now the total current I is also applied here at the capacitance so then I know when I points in this direction the voltage at the capacitance must lag 90 degrees behind so it must point into this direction 90 degrees to the current flowing through the capacitance. And then let's shift this one up here and we have then once again a vector addition and U is equal to UL plus UC this leads to this blue phaser here for the total voltage U and we have something around about minus 50 degrees here between the current I and the voltage U. Okay that's it for exercise number four, servos and see you next time."} {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "The given transcript is a summary of a lecture on AC circuits, specifically exercises 4 and 3.
