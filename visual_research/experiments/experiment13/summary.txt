The speaker repeatedly claims that they will get the person they are addressing, but they never do. The speaker is convinced that the person will arrive, but they never show up. The speaker's behavior is perceived as manipulative and controlling, as they use phrases such as "I'm going to get you" to assert their power and dominance. The speaker's actions are also seen as deceitful, as they repeatedly promise to arrive but fail to do so. This pattern of behavior is indicative of narcissistic personality disorder, a mental health condition characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance and a lack of empathy for others.
