**Introduction**

**Assessing the significance of lecture video segments and transcript segments requires a unified representation that captures both visual and textual semantics. The goal is to derive a reference embedding from an LLM-generated summary of the lecture (text), and then compare other video and text segments against this reference using cosine similarity in a shared embedding space. To avoid the pitfalls of generating synthetic images from text (which can introduce noise or misrepresent content), we seek an alternative strategy: leverage multimodal embedding models that natively align video (visual content, and optionally audio) with text, without any image synthesis.**

**Challenges and Requirements**

- **Cross-Modal Alignment: We need to map both visual content (from video frames or sequences) and textual content (transcripts or summaries) into the same semantic vector space so that cosine similarity is meaningful. This requires models or techniques trained on multimodal data (e.g. image-text or video-text pairs) to ensure shared embeddings ([CLIP Model and The Importance of Multimodal Embeddings | by Fahim Rustamy, PhD | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/data-science/clip-model-and-the-importance-of-multimodal-embeddings-1c8f6b13bf72#:~:text=CLIP%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Contrastive,the%20flikker%20and%20COCO%20datasets)) ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=The%20image%20embedding%20vector%20and,or%20searching%20video%20by%20image)).**
- **No Image Synthesis for Reference: The straightforward approach of generating an image from the summary (e.g. via text-to-image) and then embedding it is undesirable. Instead, the reference should remain in the text domain (summary embedding) or be augmented with actual video content features, avoiding hallucinated visuals.**
- **Different Granularities: Significance might manifest at different levels:**
  - ***Frame-level:* A single slide frame might contain a key diagram or definition.**
  - ***Scene-level:* A continuous segment (e.g. a slide or a demo sequence) conveys a concept.**
  - ***Video-level:* The entire lecture’s main themes (captured by the summary).
    The approach should handle comparisons at these levels, identifying both fine-grained and high-level significance.**
- **Multimodal Cues: The lecture video consists primarily of slides (visual text and graphics) and spoken audio (reflected in the transcript). Visual cues like slide titles or important graphs must be captured by the video embedding, while the transcript’s meaning is captured by text embedding. The method should ideally incorporate both visual and audio modalities of the video for completeness (though the transcript text already covers spoken content, audio tone or emphasis could be additional signals).**

**Multimodal Embedding Approach Overview**

**To compare video and text segments directly, we employ a common embedding space strategy ([An Easy Introduction to Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Video and Audio | NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/an-easy-introduction-to-multimodal-retrieval-augmented-generation-for-video-and-audio/#:~:text=Using%20a%20common%20embedding%20space)). In practice, this means using a model (or a combination of models) that can encode images/video and text into vectors of the same dimension and semantic space. With such a model, cosine similarity can measure the relevance between any video frame/segment and any text segment (e.g. the summary) ([Building In-Video Search. Empowering video editors with… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c#:~:text=Typically%20embedding%20spaces%20are%20hundred%2Fthousand,dimensional)). Our approach will involve the following steps (expanded in the pipeline section):**

1. **Textual Reference Embedding: Encode the transcript summary (LLM-generated) into a vector using a text encoder.**
1. **Video Segment Embedding: Encode segments of the video (frames or sequences) into vectors using a visual or multimodal encoder, *without* generating any new images.**
1. **Shared Vector Space: Ensure both encoders produce embeddings in the same space so that we can directly compute similarities ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=The%20image%20embedding%20vector%20and,or%20searching%20video%20by%20image)).**
1. **Cosine Similarity Comparison: Compute cosine similarity between each segment (video or text) vector and the reference summary vector to quantify significance.**
1. **Multi-level Analysis: Optionally, repeat the process at different granularities (individual frames, scenes, or entire video) to capture significance at various levels.**

**By using actual video content for the “video reference” instead of synthetic images, we preserve real semantic cues present in the lecture slides and footage. The key is choosing the right model or technique for the video-text multimodal embedding.**

**Models for Shared Video-Text Embeddings**

**Several state-of-the-art models and techniques can map video (or images) and text into a unified embedding space. Below we highlight suitable models and how they can be applied:**

- **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining): CLIP is a two-tower model (image encoder and text encoder) trained to project images and captions into the same embedding space ([CLIP Model and The Importance of Multimodal Embeddings | by Fahim Rustamy, PhD | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/data-science/clip-model-and-the-importance-of-multimodal-embeddings-1c8f6b13bf72#:~:text=CLIP%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Contrastive,the%20flikker%20and%20COCO%20datasets)). It was originally for image-text pairs, but it provides an excellent foundation for video because a video frame can be treated like an image. CLIP learns to bring related images and texts closer in the space while separating unrelated ones ([CLIP Model and The Importance of Multimodal Embeddings | by Fahim Rustamy, PhD | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/data-science/clip-model-and-the-importance-of-multimodal-embeddings-1c8f6b13bf72#:~:text=CLIP%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Contrastive,the%20flikker%20and%20COCO%20datasets)). Using CLIP, one can encode a video frame (with the image tower) and the summary or transcript text (with the text tower) to get comparable vectors. Although CLIP was trained on static images, videos can be handled by sampling frames. For example, encoding a representative frame (or multiple frames) from a video segment and averaging their embeddings is a simple way to represent the segment in CLIP’s space. Netflix researchers found that image-text models like CLIP are an *“excellent starting point”* for video representations; for short shots, a simple mean-pooling of frame embeddings works effectively as a video representation ([Building In-Video Search. Empowering video editors with… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c#:~:text=While%20these%20models%20are%20trained,This%20additional%20adaptation%20step)). This suggests that with CLIP, we can take e.g. one frame per slide or key frames in a segment, get image embeddings and average them to approximate the segment’s semantic content. The resulting vector will be directly comparable to text embeddings from CLIP’s text encoder. *(Note:* CLIP by itself doesn’t explicitly use audio, but since the transcript covers spoken content, the main need is visual-text alignment.)**
- **VideoCLIP and CLIP Extensions for Video: Building on CLIP, there are extended approaches designed for video-text alignment. *VideoCLIP* (and similar frameworks like CLIP4Clip, X-CLIP, ECLIPSE) train on video-caption pairs to create a unified video-text space. For instance, VideoCLIP (as implemented in some HuggingFace models) uses a dedicated video encoder with a temporal aggregation mechanism (such as a “Video Q-Former” or transformer) to combine frame-level features into a single video embedding ([AskYoutube/AskVideos-VideoCLIP-v0.1 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/AskYoutube/AskVideos-VideoCLIP-v0.1#:~:text=Like%20it%27s%20image,to%20compute%20similarity%20with%20text)). The video encoder is trained with a contrastive loss (and sometimes auxiliary losses like caption generation) to align that video embedding with the corresponding text description ([AskYoutube/AskVideos-VideoCLIP-v0.1 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/AskYoutube/AskVideos-VideoCLIP-v0.1#:~:text=Like%20it%27s%20image,to%20compute%20similarity%20with%20text)). This results in a model that, like CLIP, produces embeddings for an entire video clip and a text segment in the same space, which can be compared via cosine similarity. In practical terms, using a pre-trained video-text model means you can feed in a sequence of frames (or the raw video) and get an embedding that already captures the sequence’s overall meaning. These models often outperform naive frame averaging because they learn which frames are important and how to weigh them. For our use case, a model like VideoCLIP can directly yield an embedding for a lecture segment (taking into account multiple frames over time) that aligns with text semantics (like a summary or transcript segment).**
- **Video-Audio-Text Transformers (VATT): VATT is a fully multimodal transformer architecture that handles video, audio, and text in one model ([VATT Explained | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/method/vatt#:~:text=%2A%2AVideo,transformer%29%20except%20the%20layer%20of)). It learns self-supervised representations from raw video, sound, and text by mapping each modality into a common space using a unified transformer encoder ([VATT Explained | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/method/vatt#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20it%20takes%20raw%20signals,modality%20into%20a%20feature%20vector)) ([VATT Explained | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/method/vatt#:~:text=frameworks%20and%20tasks,employed%20to%20train%20the%20model)). Essentially, VATT projects each modality’s input (e.g. video frames, audio waveform, text tokens) into a sequence of features, feeds them through modality-specific tokenization and then through a shared transformer. The model is trained with noise-contrastive estimation across modalities to create a *“semantically hierarchical common space”* for video, audio, and text ([VATT Explained | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/method/vatt#:~:text=frameworks%20and%20tasks,employed%20to%20train%20the%20model)). For the user’s problem, VATT (or similar multimodal transformers) could take the lecture’s video frames and audio as input and produce an embedding, while also encoding text (like a transcript summary) into that same space. Because it was trained to align these three modalities, the output vectors are directly comparable. VATT has the advantage of leveraging audio cues in addition to visuals, which might help if, say, the speaker’s intonation or sound effects indicate emphasis (though for lectures, the transcript text already covers most semantic content). Using such a model would allow us to generate a video reference embedding from the actual video (and audio) content of the lecture without any image synthesis, and compare it to text embeddings.**
- **FLAVA (Foundational Language and Vision Alignment): FLAVA is a multimodal model from Meta AI that unifies vision and language representations ([FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model](http://flava-model.github.io/#:~:text=FLAVA%20Model)). It uses a common transformer architecture with separate image and text encoders and a multimodal fusion encoder ([FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model](http://flava-model.github.io/#:~:text=FLAVA%20Model)). FLAVA is trained on both paired image-text data (contrastive objectives like CLIP) and unimodal data with masked prediction objectives, making it versatile for vision, language, and multi-modal reasoning tasks ([FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model](http://flava-model.github.io/#:~:text=State,a%20model%20and%20demonstrate%20impressive)) ([FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model](http://flava-model.github.io/#:~:text=FLAVA%20Model)). In practice, one can use FLAVA to get an aligned embedding for an image (through the image encoder) and a text (through the text encoder) in a shared space. While FLAVA is image-text (not video) by design, applying it to video segments is feasible by treating key frames as images. Because it was trained to align image and text semantics, a slide frame fed into FLAVA’s image encoder and the corresponding transcript text fed into its text encoder will yield vectors that can be directly compared. Its multimodal training may give it some robustness on abstract or text-heavy images (like slides) as well. Thus, FLAVA could be a good model if one expects to leverage both direct image-text alignment and more complex reasoning (though it would not explicitly handle audio or motion unless extended).**
- **VideoMAE (Masked Autoencoder for Video): VideoMAE is a self-supervised video model that learns powerful video representations by masking and reconstructing video patches (analogous to Masked Autoencoders for images) ([VideoMAE: Masked Autoencoders are Data-Efficient Learners for...](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AhccnBXSne#:~:text=Summary%3A%20This%20paper%20presents%20a,The%20idea%20of%20this)). VideoMAE on its own produces high-quality video embeddings (often used for action recognition or video classification tasks), but it does not inherently align with text since it learns from video-only data. However, it can be used in a pipeline for significance: for example, use VideoMAE to encode each video segment into a feature vector that captures the visual content, and use a separate language model to encode text, then align these embeddings via a secondary mechanism. One strategy is to train a small neural projector or use a contrastive fine-tuning on a smaller dataset of video-text pairs (if available) to map VideoMAE’s features into the same space as text. Another strategy is to combine VideoMAE with a text embedding model in a two-tower setup and train a contrastive objective (similar to how CLIP was done, but using VideoMAE for the video tower). This would yield a shared embedding space for video and text. In summary, VideoMAE ensures video-level feature richness, and with additional alignment steps, it can contribute to a video-text similarity pipeline. If one doesn’t have resources to fine-tune, an alternative is to use VideoMAE features and textual embeddings in a downstream model (like an SVM or MLP) to predict significance, but that steps outside pure cosine similarity comparison.**
- **Latest Multimodal Models (“etc.”): Beyond the above, there are emerging models that create joint embeddings across many modalities:**
  - **ImageBind (Meta, 2023): A model that binds six modalities (vision, text, audio, depth, thermal, and motion) into one embedding space ([CLIP Model and The Importance of Multimodal Embeddings | by Fahim Rustamy, PhD | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/data-science/clip-model-and-the-importance-of-multimodal-embeddings-1c8f6b13bf72#:~:text=The%20underlying%20technology%20for%20CLIP,modality%20AI%20systems)). ImageBind extends the CLIP philosophy to many data types; for example, it can take an audio clip or an image and produce vectors that are comparable to text embeddings. This is promising for video, since it can handle audio and visual inputs together. An ImageBind-based approach could encode a video by feeding video frames (image modality) and possibly audio (audio modality) to get a joint embedding, and encode text via its text modality encoder – all yielding vectors in the same 768-dimensional space (as reported by Meta). This model inherently does what we need: *“learns a joint embedding across [multiple] modalities — images, text, audio…”* ([CLIP Model and The Importance of Multimodal Embeddings | by Fahim Rustamy, PhD | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/data-science/clip-model-and-the-importance-of-multimodal-embeddings-1c8f6b13bf72#:~:text=The%20underlying%20technology%20for%20CLIP,modality%20AI%20systems)). Such a comprehensive model can capture cross-modal cues without explicit pairing for each during inference.**
  - **CLAP (Contrastive Language–Audio Pretraining): While not directly about video, CLAP is to audio what CLIP is to images ([CLIP Model and The Importance of Multimodal Embeddings | by Fahim Rustamy, PhD | TDS Archive | Medium](https://medium.com/data-science/clip-model-and-the-importance-of-multimodal-embeddings-1c8f6b13bf72#:~:text=The%20original%20CLIP%20model%20aimed,search%20functionalities%20within%20audio%20applications)). It aligns audio and text embeddings. In a lecture scenario, if one cared about the *audio* track’s non-verbal information (like cheers, laughter, or tone), CLAP could embed those audio segments to compare with text. But since lecture audio mostly conveys speech (covered by transcript text), CLAP is less critical here except as part of a larger multimodal like VATT or ImageBind.**

**In choosing a model, we should consider practical constraints: CLIP and its extensions are widely available and fast for embedding, whereas a model like VATT or FLAVA might require heavier computation (transformer over long video sequences) or more complex fine-tuning. A reasonable starting point might be CLIP (for simplicity) or a ready-made video-text model (like a pre-trained VideoCLIP) for better accuracy. These models ensure that video frames/shots and text are encoded in the same latent space, enabling cosine similarity comparisons directly ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=The%20image%20embedding%20vector%20and,or%20searching%20video%20by%20image)).**

**Granularity: Frame-Level, Scene-Level, and Video-Level**

**Different levels of granularity can be analyzed to understand significance from micro to macro scales:**

- **Frame-Level Embeddings: By embedding individual frames, we can identify which specific visuals are most similar to the reference summary. For instance, a single frame that contains the slide titled “Conclusion” might have high similarity to the summary (since summaries often emphasize conclusions). Frame-level analysis can highlight *key frames* that strongly align with the overall topic (or outliers that might indicate something important or off-topic). However, frame-level embeddings can be noisy – a single frame might lack context. It’s useful to apply frame-level analysis in moderation, perhaps focusing on keyframes (like those with a lot of text or a diagram) rather than every video frame.**
- **Scene-Level or Segment-Level Embeddings: This is usually the most insightful level for lectures. A scene or segment could correspond to a slide (if the video is slide-based, each slide change defines a segment) or a topic block in the lecture. We can define a scene as a continuous segment where the content is about one subtopic. To get an embedding for a scene, we can aggregate multiple frame embeddings or directly process the sequence with a video model. A simple and effective approach, as noted, is to use an unparameterized aggregation (mean-pooling) of frame vectors for short segments ([Building In-Video Search. Empowering video editors with… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c#:~:text=While%20these%20models%20are%20trained,This%20additional%20adaptation%20step)). For example, if a scene spans 20 seconds, we might sample 2 frames per second, get 40 CLIP image embeddings, and take their mean as the scene’s embedding. This averaged vector represents the scene’s overall visual content. If using a specialized video encoder (like a transformer), we could feed those frames in and use the output token (or average of output) as the scene embedding. Scene-level embeddings smooth out frame-by-frame variability and include temporal context (e.g., the presence of a sequence of related images). They are well-suited to compare with the summary embedding because a summary typically covers coarse-grained information. By computing cosine similarity between each scene’s embedding and the reference, we can rank which scenes are most central to the lecture’s main points.**
- **Video-Level Embedding: An embedding for the entire video (the whole lecture) can also be obtained by, say, averaging all frame embeddings, or better, averaging all scene embeddings (which is effectively a second-order average). Many models could also directly output a single representation for the whole video if fed the entire sequence (though memory constraints might force chunking). The video-level embedding should, in theory, be very close to the summary’s embedding if the summary accurately captures the lecture’s content. In fact, the reference embedding we use is derived from the transcript summary, which is essentially a text representation of the entire video. If we were to embed the entire video visually, we might consider combining that with the summary to form a multi-modal reference. However, since the summary likely captures the key points, using it alone as reference is usually sufficient. Video-level embedding is more useful as a validation (e.g., check that the summary embedding and video embedding are aligned) or if one wanted to compare *two different videos* in significance space. In our context, we will primarily compare sub-parts to the single reference.**

**Note on scene segmentation: It’s important to define the segments in a meaningful way. For slide-based lectures, each slide transition can mark a new segment. If the lecture is not strictly slide-based (e.g., some live coding demo or whiteboard writing), one might use shot detection (a change in the visual content) or even the transcript’s paragraph structure to segment the video. Once segments are defined, each can be handled as above.**

**Embedding Pipeline and Similarity Computation**

**To integrate the above ideas, we propose the following embedding pipeline (illustrated conceptually in the steps below) to generate and use reference embeddings for both video and text segments:**

1. **Generate Transcript Summary: Using an LLM (which the user already did), obtain a concise summary of the entire lecture’s transcript. This summary should highlight the main topics and significant points of the lecture. This will serve as our reference text representing the video’s overall significance.**
1. **Encode Reference Text Embedding: Feed the summary text into the text encoder of a multimodal model (e.g., CLIP’s text tower, FLAVA’s text encoder, VATT’s text input pipeline, etc.). The output is a fixed-dimensional reference embedding vector (say, v\_ref) in the joint semantic space. This vector is our baseline for “100% significance” content, since it represents the whole lecture’s key ideas in language form.**
1. **Segment the Lecture (Video & Transcript): Divide the lecture into segments for analysis. This could be done by slide boundaries or time windows. Ensure you have the video frames for each segment and the corresponding transcript snippet (if analyzing text segments as well). For each segment:**
   1. **Extract a set of representative frames. For example, if using frame-based embedding with CLIP, you might take 1 frame every X seconds or the frame where a new bullet point appears. Quality over quantity: pick frames that are in-focus and contain the relevant slide content.**
   1. **(Optional) Extract the audio clip of that segment if using an audio-aware model (like VATT or ImageBind).**
   1. **Retrieve the transcript text of that segment (one could also summarize each segment’s text if wanting to embed a shorter version, but raw transcript or cleaned transcript is fine for embedding).**
1. **Compute Video Segment Embedding: For each segment, compute an embedding that captures its visual (and possibly audio) content:**
   1. **If using a two-tower model (CLIP/FLAVA): pass each frame through the image encoder to get image embeddings. Then aggregate these into one vector for the segment. A simple average (mean-pool) of frame embeddings works surprisingly well for short segments ([Building In-Video Search. Empowering video editors with… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c#:~:text=While%20these%20models%20are%20trained,This%20additional%20adaptation%20step)), yielding a segment-level visual embedding v\_vis\_segment. More sophisticated alternatives include using the max (to focus on the most salient frame) or a weighted average (if certain frames are more important, though weighting criteria might require additional heuristics like detecting text density on the slide). If the segment is just one slide static image, then one frame’s embedding is enough.**
   1. **If using a video model (VideoCLIP, VATT): feed the entire sequence of frames (and audio, for VATT) into the model to directly obtain a segment embedding. These models internally handle the aggregation (e.g., VideoCLIP’s Q-Former will attend across frames to produce one vector ([AskYoutube/AskVideos-VideoCLIP-v0.1 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/AskYoutube/AskVideos-VideoCLIP-v0.1#:~:text=Like%20it%27s%20image,to%20compute%20similarity%20with%20text))). The output is v\_vis\_segment in the joint space, already aligned to text.**
   1. **Ensure that the dimension of v\_vis\_segment matches that of v\_ref and is in the same space. With models like CLIP/VideoCLIP/VATT, this is inherently true by design ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=The%20image%20embedding%20vector%20and,or%20searching%20video%20by%20image)) (they produce, say, 512-D or 768-D vectors for any modality input).**
   1. ***Handling slide text:* If slides contain a lot of text (like bullet points or titles), note that an image encoder might or might not fully capture that text’s semantics. Some models (like Google’s Multimodal Embedding API) claim to internally OCR and understand image text ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=%2A%20Text%20in%20images%20,depending%20on%20your%20use%20case)). If using a model that doesn’t, one strategy is to perform OCR on the slide frame to extract the text, then feed that text through the text encoder as well. You could then combine the visual and OCR-text embeddings (by concatenation or averaging) to get a richer segment representation. This ensures no loss of information from slides. This is an additional step if needed for accuracy, but not strictly required if the model or summary already covers the content.**
1. **Compute Text Segment Embedding (for transcript segments): In parallel, you may want to assess text segments from the transcript for significance. Using the same text encoder, encode each segment’s transcript (or its sub-summary) into a vector v\_text\_segment. This way, we have an embedding purely from the text modality of that segment. (If the lecture is well-captioned by the transcript, v\_text\_segment should be close to v\_vis\_segment for that segment in the space, assuming the model aligns them well.)**
1. **Similarity Calculation: Now, for each segment, we have:**
   1. **v\_vis\_segment = embedding of the video content (visual, possibly audio) of the segment.**
   1. **v\_text\_segment = embedding of the text content of the segment (optional, but useful for cross-check).**
   1. **v\_ref = embedding of the reference summary (text) for the whole lecture. We calculate cosine similarity between each segment vector and the reference:**
   1. **Video-vs-Reference: sim\_vis = cos\_sim(v\_vis\_segment, v\_ref). A higher value means the visual content of that segment is more semantically similar to the overall summary. If sim\_vis is high, that segment likely contains core visuals that match the main topics (e.g. a slide that says “Results Overview” will likely match a summary that mentions results). If sim\_vis is low, that segment’s visuals might be tangential (e.g. a slide with an unrelated anecdote image).**
   1. **Text-vs-Reference: sim\_text = cos\_sim(v\_text\_segment, v\_ref). This indicates how much the spoken/written content of that segment overlaps with the summary. High similarity suggests the segment covers a key point from the summary; low suggests it's a detail or side note not in the summary.**
   1. **Both similarities are comparable if everything is in one space. Since all vectors are in the shared space, we can directly compare numbers across modalities ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=The%20image%20embedding%20vector%20and,or%20searching%20video%20by%20image)). For example, a visual segment with similarity 0.8 and a text segment with 0.9 are both quite significant, whereas anything near 0 (or negative, if vectors are not normalized) would be insignificant relative to the summary.**

**Cosine similarity is an appropriate measure here because the vectors are high-dimensional semantic embeddings. In the Netflix video search example, they explicitly use cosine similarity in the embedding space to match text queries with video frames ([Building In-Video Search. Empowering video editors with… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c#:~:text=Typically%20embedding%20spaces%20are%20hundred%2Fthousand,dimensional)). A similar principle applies: the summary is like a “query” and the segments are like “documents” to rank by relevance.**

1. **Ranking and Thresholding: After computing similarities, we can rank segments by their score to see which parts of the lecture were most on-topic or significant. We may also set a threshold: e.g., any segment with cosine similarity above a certain value is considered “significant” (contains content closely reflected in the summary). Segments below might be less important or possibly supplementary content. This helps in highlighting important video segments for review or skipping low-importance parts.**
1. **Multilevel Interpretation: If we did the above at multiple granularities (frames, scenes), we would interpret accordingly:**
   1. **A frame with a high score might be worth showing as a highlight (e.g., “This image/frame is very representative of the lecture’s key points”).**
   1. **A scene with a consistently high score means the entire segment is crucial (likely directly covering a main point).**
   1. **If a scene has mixed frame scores, it might contain both important and unimportant moments; the average might dilute it, so one could drill down to frame level to see the peak.**
   1. **The entire video’s embedding v\_video\_all (if computed) should be very similar to v\_ref by construction (especially if v\_ref came from the transcript of that video). Any discrepancy might indicate missing visual info in the summary.**

**The pipeline above ensures that we never generate fake images – all visual embeddings come from real video frames. The use of a shared embedding model allows direct video-text comparison. An illustration of this concept is given by the Google Cloud multimodal API: *“The image embedding vector and text embedding vector are in the same semantic space with the same dimensionality… these vectors can be used interchangeably for use cases like searching image by text, or searching video by image.”* ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=The%20image%20embedding%20vector%20and,or%20searching%20video%20by%20image)). In our case, we are effectively “searching video segments by text (the summary)” – if a segment’s visual content matches the text query (summary), the cosine similarity will be high.**

**Preserving Semantic and Visual Cues Across Modalities**

**One of the challenges in multimodal embedding is ensuring that important details in one modality are not lost when translated to the joint space. Here are some considerations and best practices for preserving and interpreting significance cues:**

- **Slide Text and Diagrams: Lecture slides often contain textual bullet points, formulas, or diagrams. A vanilla image encoder (like CLIP’s ResNet or ViT) might not explicitly read the text in an image. If the model has not been exposed to a lot of images containing text during training, it could treat the text as just visual patterns. This means a slide that says “Conclusion: X, Y, Z” might not automatically map near a text embedding of “X, Y, Z conclusions” unless the model learned some correlation (e.g., maybe similar slides were in its training set with alt-text). To mitigate this:**
  - **Use models or services known to handle embedded text. For example, the Google multimodal embedding model notes that it can distinguish text in images similar to OCR ([Get multimodal embeddings  |  Generative AI  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#:~:text=%2A%20Text%20in%20images%20,depending%20on%20your%20use%20case)), which would help align slide text with transcript text.**
  - **Incorporate an OCR + text-embedding pipeline for critical frames. If a slide has a lot of text, run OCR to get that text and then embed it with the same text encoder. Merging this with the image embedding (by averaging vectors or concatenating features in a multimodal encoder if available) can significantly boost the semantic alignment. Essentially, you give the model the actual slide text as input instead of hoping it’s read implicitly.**
  - **Diagrams and charts might not have readable text but carry semantic meaning (e.g., a pie chart about revenue). CLIP-like models trained on internet data might surprisingly know something about typical charts if their alt-text was descriptive. However, if the visual is very domain-specific (say a unique scientific graph), the embedding might not fully capture it. In such cases, rely more on the spoken explanation (transcript) of that diagram for significance, as the transcript likely describes the key insight of the figure.**
- **Audio cues: In lectures, the audio channel (voice) primarily conveys the text that we already have as transcript. Yet, there could be emphasis (speaker says *“This is very important”* with a tone) or other sounds (laughter at a joke slide, etc.) that indicate significance or a shift in content. A model like VATT or ImageBind that includes audio could, in theory, incorporate these cues (for instance, laughter might signal that segment is a light aside, perhaps not in the serious summary). If using such a model, ensure the audio segment is fed in. If not using an audio-aware model, one could do a simpler analysis: detect applause or changes in volume/pitch as metadata to possibly adjust significance (though this is a minor effect in most lectures).**
- **Temporal context and motion: If the lecture involves the presenter on video or any motion (e.g., writing on a board), temporal models (VideoCLIP, VATT) will capture that better than frame-based approaches. For significance, motion might not be a primary factor unless the action itself is meaningful (e.g., a live demo). But consider if the presence of the speaker’s gestures or a demonstration might need to be captured. Scene-level aggregation tends to blur motion, which is fine for slides, but if analyzing, say, a lab demo video, one might use a short window so that the action isn’t lost. Always align the method to the content type.**
- **Aligning embeddings qualitatively: After choosing a model and computing embeddings, it’s wise to do a sanity check. For example, take a few known segments: perhaps the introduction, a main point slide, and a tangential anecdote. Compute their similarities to the summary. We expect the introduction and main point to have higher similarity, and the anecdote to have lower. If this isn’t reflected, the model might not be capturing something. In CLIP’s case, maybe the anecdote slide had a big image that CLIP thinks is relevant (visually) even though it’s off-topic – that could cause a false high similarity. Recognizing such cases might prompt incorporating more textual data for that slide (so the embedding isn’t purely based on the image). Fine-tuning the model on a small set of lecture data (if available) or adjusting the segmentation can help.**
- **Cosine similarity and vector norms: Ensure using cosine similarity (or normalized embeddings) so that differences in vector magnitude don’t skew results. Many models output normalized embeddings by default (CLIP does L2 normalization on embeddings when computing similarity), but if not, you should normalize them before comparison. Cosine similarity will give a value from -1 to 1 (though in practice, likely 0 to 1 for relevant content since unrelated random things might be near-orthogonal). You might interpret, for instance, >0.8 as strongly significant, 0.5-0.8 as moderately relevant, etc., depending on distribution.**
- **Multi-modal fusion for reference: If one suspects that the text summary alone might miss some visual significance, an advanced idea is to create a multimodal reference embedding by actually combining the summary text with a representation of the entire video (all slides). For example, encode the entire video (all frames or a selection of them) into one vector v\_all\_video by mean-pooling, and then average that with the summary’s text vector v\_ref\_text. This fused v\_ref\_multi now contains both what was said and what was shown. Use that as the reference for similarity. This can make the reference more robust to cases where something important was shown but not emphasized in text. One must be careful that this doesn’t over-weight visual info (the summary is presumably well-crafted). But it’s an option if purely text-based reference doesn’t capture all significant points (especially in visually heavy lectures).**
- **Model fine-tuning vs. out-of-the-box: For initial implementation, using pre-trained models (CLIP, etc.) is easiest. However, for optimal alignment, a domain-specific fine-tuning can improve results. The Netflix research noted that fine-tuning a pretrained image-text model on their video dataset with textual descriptions gave 15–25% improvement on video retrieval tasks ([Building In-Video Search. Empowering video editors with… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-in-video-search-936766f0017c#:~:text=units%2C%20although%20we%20have%20found,model%20used%20and%20metric%20evaluated)). In a lecture context, if one has a small set of lectures with known important segments (perhaps labeled or described), fine-tuning the embedding model on those (using contrastive learning or supervised signals for importance) could improve accuracy. This might be beyond the scope, but it’s useful to know that pre-trained models can be adapted further to the domain of “slides and lecture speech” for even better alignment.**

**Conclusion**

**In summary, to evaluate the significance of lecture video segments and text segments relative to an overall summary, one should employ a multimodal embedding pipeline instead of generating proxy images from text. By using models that project visuals and text into a shared vector space, such as CLIP and its video extensions, VATT, FLAVA, or similar multimodal transformers, we can directly compare the content across modalities using cosine similarity. We recommend encoding the lecture’s summary with a text encoder to form the reference significance vector, and encoding video segments using a visual (or video) encoder applied to actual frames (optionally enhanced with audio or OCR text) to get comparable embeddings. With this approach, segments that cover content similar to the summary will naturally yield high cosine similarity, indicating high significance, while off-topic or minor-detail segments will show lower similarity.**

**This strategy respects the integrity of each modality: it uses real video content for video embeddings and real text for text embeddings, aligning them through a learned joint representation. By analyzing significance at frame-level, scene-level, and video-level, we can gain a detailed understanding of which parts of the lecture are most crucial. Modern multimodal models make this feasible – for instance, *“once properly trained, the embeddings for corresponding images and text (i.e. captions) will be close to each other”* ([Building In-Video Search.

Ultimately, the combination of a well-chosen model and a careful pipeline will yield a robust significance ranking that guides the user to the most important segments in both video and transcript, without any need for generating artificial images.**
