The exercise involves calculating the total voltage and current in a parallel AC circuit with a coil, capacitor, and resistance. The voltage applied to the circuit is known, and the current through the coil is known to be two amps. The total current and voltage are calculated using phasor diagrams, and the phase angle between the current and voltage is determined. The phase shift between the current and voltage is calculated using the initial phase difference between the two quantities. The results are compared to the results from exercise number three, and the phase diagram is visualized to illustrate the relationships between the quantities. The key concepts involved are phasor diagrams, impedance, voltage, and current, and the use of vector addition to solve the problem.
