i would say , humanistic view on war . because it ' s not like the sort of glorification of , you know , the good guys that , well , go against the nazis . but it ' s . . . well , the plot , actually , you don ' t know it . it ' s about people looking for just one soldier , in fact . it ' s about a family of four brothers , who actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of , well , i guess , summer 44 . and , well , the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother , just to save one member of the family . and this guy is private ryan . so the movie is not about killing the germans or whatever . it ' s about saving at least one guy from a family . so , but , of course , the setting is during the war , and it ' s very realistic and very traumatic , in fact . it ' s not at all a glorification of war , but it shows a bit the violence of the things . and especially the beginning is , i think it ' s great . it ' s very violent , but it ' s an image of war . yeah . it ' s quite horrible , actually . very violent . yeah , i think if . . . well , if you compare it to . . . i saw it , and i ' m trying to remember the beginning . that ' s the normal building . yeah , it ' s the normal building . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . and actually , everyone gets killed . it ' s a piece of art , because you used something like 100 camera to film that . oh , i don ' t know . yeah , actually , it ' s very well filmed , and it ' s very realistic . and i don ' t know if you compare with , i don ' t know , in lawrence of arabia . i think they have some battles and camels . i know it ' s very nice . it ' s nice , someone falls somewhere there , and . . . well , you know , it ' s like battles that look nice , but this one doesn ' t look nice . no , no , no . and i think it ' s also maybe representative of the 90s , you know , people starting to get a more realistic view of war . but it ' s true . it ' s a bit violent . and so what i put here , it ' s a bit long , too . it ' s nearly three hours . but i don ' t know . apocalypse now is quite long , too . yeah , it is . there is too . there are too versions , i think . the redux version is longer . yeah , we projected the longer one . so it won five oscar prizes , best director for steven spielberg , best symmetography , et cetera . how many times spielberg received the best director . . . i think just one for this . not for the fin schleender list , or . . . oh , maybe he did . for et . no , for et , he didn ' t . he won ' t . . . it wasn ' t until he started doing things like schleender ' s list , and saving private ryan that he actually started winning awards for . . . no , he won ' t for et , he won ' t . . . did he ? what is palme d ' or ? okay . yeah . good , that ' s . . . okay , so , yeah , that ' s the point . it ' s a bit gray , and actually , if you look at my second page , in the trivia , i found out that , in fact , they actually reduced the color saturation of the movie , just to make it look maybe a bit like the documents , or really . . . that was very interesting to read the time . yeah , i was very surprised to find this . but then , i read that they . . . where was it ? they turned back the colors . they reentered the colors . they turned back the colors . because people start to complain that . . . that was their tv , isn ' t it ? that was a problem with the tv when they were broadcasting the movie on the tv . yeah . so this fact number two , i think , obviously firm , it ' s an interesting point . it ' s quite funny . it ' s quite funny . so , yeah , so , i mean , these four points could serve also as an introduction , if you want to talk for five or ten minutes before the movie , i don ' t know , in the room . so , yeah , so then this would be my candidate , but i ' m very much . . . and then there is a new hero , i mean , it ' s a non - hero . and in all the other stories in the previous movies , there were a new hero , lorenzo of arabia , amadeus . apocalypse now , it ' s also non - hero , i think . but yeah , i don ' t remember . it ' s actually the . . . yeah , it ' s the hero . yeah , the picture , actually . yeah , it ' s tom hanks . in fact , you don ' t see private ryan until the end , more or less , or you see . . . yeah , but there is a way through the movie . most of the movies , they ' re trying to find him on the front . is private ryan ? no . no , no , no . no , no . he ' s trying to find him . yeah , he ' s trying to find him . well , the caption says captain john miller . so , yeah , if you look at the caption . . . yeah , so . . . and then private ryan was matt damon . yeah , so the private is just a simple soldier , actually . yeah . by the way , did he finally . . . did he finally or not ? who ? private ryan ? no , no , they find him , actually , and they send him back to the family . but the captain dies , actually . is it him at the beginning of the movie at the graveyard , right ? oh , yeah , but it ' s private ryan remembering the beginning . with his family . because i remember that in the end of the movie , they are trying to defend some bridge or something , and there ' s quite heavy shooting , and finally it ' s actually john miller who died . yeah , exactly . he dies , unfortunately . so , yeah , there is sacrifice . at the end to tell you the truth , i didn ' t like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic . because there were a guy who didn ' t kill a german because he was quite non - violent . and because he didn ' t kill the german , the german killed , i don ' t know , maybe . . . perhaps it was a tomhanks , yeah . and it was like , if he had killed the . . . yeah , the german . if he would kill him , he wouldn ' t die . because he would not die . yeah , it has a moral dimension all over the movie , saving the individual and the guys . so , yeah , i don ' t know . i don ' t know how many people have seen it , well , among you , well , most of you actually have seen it . oh , okay , all of us . so , maybe people know it quite well . yeah , we are running . . . yeah , okay , so i have some other candidates . it ' s on first page at the bottom . i also put pulp fiction , the silence of the lambs . and also , well , sort of included la vita ebella , but china we are an english movie club , so i guess it ' s a bit out of the world . but it ' s the movie about la vita ebella . oh , it ' s about , again , about the camps and the second world war . so , it ' s about a family of italians , which arrives into a death camp . and in fact , it ' s treated in a more or less humorous mode . so , the father tries to hide from his boy that they are in a death camp . and is this very strange , well , not really humor , but relation between . . . how would end up with the . . . well , the boy gets saved , but the father dies . so , i don ' t know . it ' s created some controversies , i think , because people said you shouldn ' t do any form of humor related to the camps . but it ' s very , very moving , so i think it ' s . . . anyway , italians . there ' s actually a third movie about the second world war . schindler ' s list , saving private drawing and . . . yeah . . . . and vita ebella . okay . dani ? yeah , so i have quite different movie to propose you . i don ' t know . it ' s called big lebobsky from joel cohen . actually , there are browsers , you probably know them . i don ' t know how many of you have seen this movie . no . i haven ' t just partially , i think . but i heard it ' s very funny . i ' ve seen some other films by the coen brothers . yeah , they made fargo , which is in the table . and the last one was the one with catherine zettacone . cruel intentions or something like that , i think . yeah , something about cruel . okay , so i don ' t know how i ' m going to sell you this movie . because actually the plot is impossible to make . because it ' s . . . actually it ' s inspired from a movie called the big sleep . and a movie or a novel ? it ' s actually . . . where i ' ve seen that . it ' s a movie from raymond schindler , the big sleep . but they say that raymond schin
