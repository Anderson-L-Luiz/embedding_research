The speaker is discussing the use of a relational database to store and manage information from XML files, specifically in the context of a project called Atlas. They mention that using a database would allow for easy searching and querying of the data, but also acknowledge that it may be overkill for their current needs, which could be met with a flat file format and search tools. They also mention the Atlas API, which is designed to be independent of the storage method, allowing for flexibility in the future. The speaker is hesitant to commit to the full Atlas framework due to the learning curve, but suggests that using the Atlas external file representation could be a good middle ground, allowing for quick and dirty solutions now while also providing a foundation for more complex solutions later.
