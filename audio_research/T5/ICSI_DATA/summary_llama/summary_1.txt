The speaker is discussing the development of a database format to link up word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts with time marks for words and phone boundaries. They mention a previous discussion with Morgan about making it easy to bleep things out, but Morgan wants to make it hard. The speaker proposes an XML format with a single timeline tag, containing time stamps, and optional tags for accuracy, id, utterance, and noise type. They also discuss the handling of forced alignments, phone labels, and transcriptions with changing time boundaries. The speaker suggests using a binary representation for phone level information and using an existing format like p-file for frame level representation of features. They also discuss the advantages of sharing large files by referencing external resources rather than including them in the database format.
