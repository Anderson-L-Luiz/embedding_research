The speaker is discussing a problem with merging different annotations of the same word sequence in a dataset. They mention that when different people annotate the same data, they may have different tags and time bins, which can make it hard to merge the annotations back into a single version. The speaker suggests using a tool that can align the annotations based on the word sequence, but notes that this is a semantic problem rather than a file format issue. They mention a hypothetical tool that could mediate between different versions of the annotations, similar to a Unix diff tool, but operating on lattices rather than text. The speaker also notes that merging annotations can be tricky because it requires specifying what is meant by "merge," and that the current approach of reducing everything to textual alignment has limitations.
