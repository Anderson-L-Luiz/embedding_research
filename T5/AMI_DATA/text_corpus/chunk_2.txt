and the guy on the left is ray leoda . you recognize them or you can read the text on the images . i recognize them . i ' m a movie buff . i know way too much about movies and stuff . it ' s the exact same actors who played in another mafia movie that i cannot . . . les affranchi , it was the name in french . no . what was it about ? about mafia . that ' s why it . . . that ' s why i didn ' t go to see this one . it seems to me they ' re all about the same . . . subject and same . . . i don ' t know . and it ' s a movie from the 90s . the one that you saw that you mentioned . probably . okay , nobody ' s seen it . no , no . probably not . silence of the lamps . should i tell something more ? good father of all trailers . that ' s what it says on the . . . what some user says . okay , it ' s a little bit horror . i think it ' s quite . . . it ' s a . . . a little bit . it ' s definitely not for kids . but if the kids are not visitors of our cinema , why not ? yeah . one have to rethink when you are watching this movie . you have to think and it ' s scaring . why not ? so it ' s about a psychopathic killer . and what was it again ? the plot ? i mean . . . so the fbi agent is assigned to help a find a missing woman and save her from a psychopathic killer with the help of another killer . so the other killer is hannibal lecter . who is in prison . he ' s in jail and he ' s . . . no , no . he tries to decrypt the other killers . he tries to help the fbi agent . but he plays head games with the fbi agent at the same time . he ' s a really . . . well , it ' s not very nasty ones . or does he ? with her ? he manages to freak her out . yeah , that ' s crazy to the point . so on the picture you can see jody foster and . . . ha - ha . the moth . who is playing the . . . the moth psychopath again ? which the one who ' s in jail or the one who . . . and the hopkins ? okay . the other one i don ' t remember . we don ' t see him very often . but he plays three games . but it ' s . . . yeah . he ' s scary now . yeah . but the plot is quite horrible . i mean , not the plot , but what the active killer wants to do is quite horrible . yeah . i vaguely remember what it is . but . . . okay . how many of us have seen it ? i ' m guessing you haven ' t seen it . no , i ' ve seen it actually twice , i think . i ' ve seen it . i think i ' ve seen it a second time on tv , but maybe not . i ' ve seen it a second time on tv . i ' ve seen it a second time on tv . but i can ' t really remember exactly all the details . i can ' t either , because i saw it right when it came out . a big long time ago it ' s from 1991 . 1991 , yeah . 1991 , yeah . 1991 , yeah . so . . . no . and i saw it when i was like 12 or 13 . yeah , me too . and at that age it was like . . . that ' s too much to young . okay . okay . american beauty was coming . . . next 7 was . . . yeah , i got a nice slide . that was very good , yeah . it ' s actually there . yeah . it ' s here , and that ' s actually my last slide . so . . . why you choose 7 movie ? i don ' t know , because it ' s nice . i was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them . okay . so american beauty , so i can perhaps read a little bit of the user comment if you want . or , yeah , you can read the plot outline on the projector . it ' s basically deep , wonderful , and penetrating movie , extraordinary irony and the psychological drama about the american life . yeah , it ' s definitely about american life . yeah , suburban life . it ' s kind of true , the critic , but on the other way it ' s quite poetic . there ' s a lot of very true things in it . yeah , poetic . yeah , you know , with the way of filming and . . . i don ' t know , i thought . . . no , it ' s quite interesting . yeah . so . . . it ' s much less dark than the other movies we have on that list . it ' s not very violent , really . well , it ' s dark , but . . . and it ' s not violent at all . okay . but it ' s more the critic that is quite crude , because all the people in this movie are psychopath in their own way . but not like violent , cutting people ' s heads and psychopaths . but there are normal people in this area . just everyone has their own issues . and what about the . . . well , that ' s picture with the girl and they see naked people in the movie or . . . actually , is it about sex ? it ' s about 50 years old man that quit his job and fell in love with the best friend of . . . his daughter . he ' s a teenage daughter . so that ' s the best friend and he fantasizes about her . yeah , it ' s a good movie . okay . and that ' s my last slide . you have seen it , miyake ? yes , yes . and i think , okay , why not ? it seems to me that perhaps a shindler . . . okay , definitely shindler ' s list is perhaps more serious topic , for sure . but . . . well , it depends . it depends what we want . do we want that people are more relaxed in our cinema or are more . . . interested in some particular things . what other things ? i mean , what should we . . . how we should . . . what should be the influence ? how we are influencing the people in the cinema ? i think we want them to see movie that they won ' t see otherwise . but i ' m not sure . then it ' s quite popular the movie we selected . yeah , i think it ' s a mixture of bringing new things to them , but also making them enjoy the show so that they come to our movie club . so , yeah , i think we shouldn ' t maybe do very mainstream movies . but , well , okay , the list here is quite . . . i don ' t know what was mainstream in europe . like , all of these movies are very mainstream for me . yeah , i think also if you look at the number of votes here . . . you don ' t vote to keep your main stream , but . . . yeah . regarding denise stable , i would say , given that this site . . . i don ' t know if it ' s mainly american , but . . . and there ' s other movies , but i think it ' s predominantly . . . yeah , i think there is . . . yeah , it ' s english speaking anyway , so . . . do you think these movies , english movies . . . yeah , but if you look at . . . there ' s movies from everywhere , but . . . yeah , but i would say mainstream are the ones that have more than whatever , 60 , 000 votes . and you can see some more . . . well , confidential films that have like . . . 10 , 000 , 20 , 000 . . . like princess mononoke , 20 , 000 . . . and whatever , the kiss love ski , it ' s 11 , 000 , the dracula . . . it ' s quite a lot for killowski , actually . yeah , it ' s quite bad at all , yeah . so , yeah , anyway , if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever . and fistone also is quite i . i don ' t know if you ' ve seen this one . it ' s the celebration , i think . it ' s a movie from swedish guy . danish , i think , it ' s the dogma movie . don ' t move , yeah . lars von pryer . yeah . okay , can we . . . yeah , let ' s discuss about your document , maybe . yeah , so it ' s . . . actually , i have made . . . yes , before the . . . i have made photo copies . i have them , denis , so . . . okay . it ' s all for you . actually , i tried to propose just one movie with some alternates . and then . . . denis , could you give me the list of the top 50 ? but do you have your own copy ? yep . okay , good , thank you . so , my proposal , which is only a proposal , would be to keep the focus on . . . more or less history and action . so , lars of arabia was okay about this guy during the first world war , so it happens outside europe and the states . but it ' s a piece of history . apocalypse now , it ' s vietnam , if i ' m correct . and , okay , my dose , that ' s much , much earlier . and it ' s not about . . . it ' s not violent , which is a nice thing , i think . but given that we would like a movie from the 90s , i thought the saving private ryan , oh , thanks for projecting the document , would keep this , more or less , this theme of history and war and action drama , while showing actually a very new , and
